Sara Kladky âœ¨

I'm a front end engineer at [Honey](http://honey.is). Before Honey, I was a technical project manager at [TED](https://www.ted.com) and worked as a freelance developer. I have a BA from [Bennington College](http://www.bennington.edu/) where I studied code in a visual art context.

I live in Brooklyn, NY. Besides programming, I enjoy fiber arts, DIY projects, and science fiction.
